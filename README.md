## Related projects
A number of related projects exist.
The most popular one is probably [video2midi](https://github.com/svsdval/video2midi).
This project also takes inspiration from [pianoroll2midi](https://github.com/mattstaib/pianoroll_to_midi).
Other related projects include [MIDI-Converter](https://github.com/41pha1/MIDI-Converter), [DeSynthesia](https://github.com/kevinlinxc/DeSynthesia/), [synthesiavideo2midi](https://github.com/devbridie/synthesiavideo2midi), more are listed [here](https://edvein-rin.github.io/synthesia-video-converter/comparison-of-existing-solutions/).
However, for all projects I either had difficulties installing all necessary dependencies (e.g. for video2midi) or the results were completely off for the examples that I tested (e.g. pianoroll2midi).
